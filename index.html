      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am starting the Rutgers Bootcamp after quitting my public accounting job.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Edison, NJ</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Watching tv shows, playing video games, sewing, exercising</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that doesn have all nighters.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Edison, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I took a few beginner programing classes (C++ & Java) in high school and college, 
        but continued with accounting. I did a few technology projects for my old job and realized
        that I was more interested in the technology side of the project and not the tax side.
        I decided to quit and wanted to learn more about coding to see if it was the right path for me.
